# Fresh Tomatoes 🍅

Fresh Tomatoes is a simple, stripped-down version of Rotten Tomatoes. It’s a small movie database where users can browse movies and leave ratings.
The goal of the project is to keep things simple and focus on the basics of a full-stack CRUD movie rating app with a clean, user-friendly interface.

## Tech-stack

Frontend: Angular
Backend: C# ASP.net core
Database: MsSQL

## Architecture

The frontend is built with Angular and is responsible for the user interface and user interactions. It communicates with the backend through a RESTful API.

The backend is an ASP.NET Core Web API written in C#, which handles business logic, data validation, and communication with the database. Data is stored in an MS SQL Server database and accessed using Entity Framework Core.

This separation keeps the frontend and backend loosely coupled, making the application easier to maintain and extend.
